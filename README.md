```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahmedsabrari/hello_world_gui.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd hello-world-gui

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Download the source code
# Extract the archive and navigate to the directory

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run directly without installation
python main.py
```

## üéØ Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
